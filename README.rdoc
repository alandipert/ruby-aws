# = Ruby/AWS - A Ruby interface to the Amazon Associates Web Services API.
# 
# == Introduction
# 
# Ruby/AWS is a Ruby language library that allows programmatic access to
# the popular Amazon Web sites via the AWS v4 API. It is the successor to the
# now obsolete Ruby/Amazon.
#
# In addition to the original
# amazon.com[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/calibanorg-20]
# site, the local sites
# amazon.co.uk[http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect-home/caliban-21],
# amazon.de[http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/redirect-home/calibanorg0a-21],
# amazon.fr[http://www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/redirect-home/caliban08-21],
# amazon.ca[http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/redirect-home/caliban-20] and
# amazon.co.jp[http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/redirect-home/calibanorg-20]
# are also supported.
#
# Although the library is still in development, the AWS v4 API is now more or
# less fully supported, with only tiny gaps in the functionality of some
# operations.
#
# The following operations are supported:
#
#  BrowseNodeLookup
#  CustomerContentLookup
#  CustomerContentSearch
#  Help
#  ItemLookup
#  ItemSearch
#  ListLookup
#  ListSearch
#  SellerListingLookup
#  SellerListingSearch
#  SellerLookup
#  SimilarityLookup
#  TagLookup
#  TransactionLookup
#
# Remote shopping-carts are also supported. This adds the following operations:
#
#  CartCreate
#  CartAdd
#  CartModify
#  CartClear
#  CartGet
# 
# In addition, multiple operations and batch requests are also supported.
#
# Ruby/AWS also offers advanced features not directly available in the AWS
# API, such as the ability to retrieve *all* results pages for a particular
# search, rather than having to manually deal with AWS responses of 10 results
# per page.
#
# You can also retrieve product images and optionally overlay them with
# percentage discount icons.
#
# Another advanced feature is the ability to cache responses returned by AWS.
# If the cache is used (as it is by default), the results of each unique
# query will be cached and used for 24 hours. The cache can be manually
# flushed of all or just the expired entries.
#
# One other useful advanced feature is the ability to determine the
# appropriate Amazon locale for a given client, based on its IP address or
# host name. This allows you to perform AWS operations using the correct
# geographical Amazon site for any given client. German and Austrian clients
# can be made to interact with amazon.de, British and Irish clients with
# amazon.co.uk, etc.
#
#
# == Installation
#
# Please see the +INSTALL+ file supplied with the software for details of how 
# to install Ruby/AWS. You can choose between an installation script and a
# RubyGems[http://www.rubygems.org/] installation.
#
# Note, however, if choosing the gem installation, that whilst Ruby/AWS's
# RubyForge UNIX name is now ruby-aaws. The ruby-aws name was taken by
# {another project}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-aws/] and this clash
# prevented remote installation of the Ruby/AWS gem.
#
#
# == Prerequisites
#
# Before you can use this library, you need to obtain an Amazon Web Services
# {access key
# ID}[https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html].
#
# You should also apply for an {Associates
# account}[http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSECommerceService/2008-04-07/GSG/BecominganAssociate.html],
# although this isn't strictly necessary. If you do not explicitly provide an
# Associates tag in your calls through Ruby/AWS, the tag of the Ruby/AWS
# author will be used by default.
#
# 
# == See Also
# 
# Ultimately, the way to get the most from this library is to read the AWS
# documentation to get a feel for what is possible, and then experiment with
# this library to see how the AWS calls are mapped into the Ruby world. You
# should also review this library's
# RDoc[http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/RDoc.html]
# documentation[http://www.caliban.org/ruby/ruby-aws/] as well as the
# plain-text +README+ file that came with the archive.
#
# Additionally, there's a
# {mailing-list}[http://www.caliban.org/mailman/listinfo/ruby-aws] available,
# where you can discuss all Ruby/AWS-related subjects and issues.
#
# Please see the Amazon Web Services
# documentation[http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=5]
# for definitive information on the capabilities and inner workings of the AWS
# API.
